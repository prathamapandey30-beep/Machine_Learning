# [Object detection using teachable machine]
This project uses Teachable Machine to identify objects using a webcam.

## 🚀 Model Link
You can access and test the live model here: 
[https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/models/d2UdUo16q_/](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/models/d2UdUo16q_/)

## 📊 Classes
The model has been trained to identify the following classes:
* **[Bottle]**: Recognizes a bottle placed in front of camera.
* **[Copy]**: Recognizes a copy placed in front of camera.
* **[Blank]**: Detects when no object is in the frame.

## 🛠️ How it was built
- **Tool:** Teachable Machine and GitHub
- Teachable machine is the online tool that allows to create machine learning model without coding such as by training with images, poses and sounds.
- Github is use to host and share the project online by uploading the code, screenshots and README file to GitHub repository.
- **Model Type:** Image Classification
- **Data Collected:** Images of bottle, copy and blank background using a webcam.

- ## Reflection
- **Supervised Learning:**
- This is supervised learning because I gave the computer labeled examples. I named each object, so it learned using correct answers.
